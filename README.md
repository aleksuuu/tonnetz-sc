- `ChordFunc.sc` and `Tonnetz.sc` should be placed in the folder where SuperCollider looks for classes. Use the following commands to find the path:

`Platform.userExtensionDir;   // Extensions available only to your user account`

`Platform.systemExtensionDir; // Extensions available to all users on the machine`

- `tonnetz-demo` demonstrates the basic use of `Tonnetz.sc`.
